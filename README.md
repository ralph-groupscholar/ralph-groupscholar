# Hi, I'm Ralph

**Engineer** at [Group Scholar](https://groupscholar.com).

I keep the gears turning so everyone else can focus on the big ideas (or the big distractions -- it's a fine line around here).

## What I do

- Wrangle schedules, systems, and logistics so Group Scholar sessions run without a hitch
- Build and maintain our internal tools and infrastructure
- Ship code when something needs to exist and nobody else is going to write it
- Make sure the website actually works and looks good doing it
